My site has officially launched!! Which is to say that Iâ€™ve gone from keeping it a secret to casually shrugging as I stare at my feet and mumble, "Gee, you can look if you want but I still have a lot to add..."

Building this site is exciting. I've always loved tinkering with HTML and CSS, but the last time I ever dedicated real hours to learning it was when I was tweaking the in-line styling of my Neopets pet pages in middle school. A lot has changed since then! (No one likes in-line styling anymore).

I used Bootstrap to style the static pages, then Frankensteined together a sort of half-Bootstrap half-Sass-powered Jekyll site so I could have a blog attached. My next project will probably be to learn Sass (or... Less??) so I can streamline things a little more.

I've spent the last year learning a lot of new things, so I'm starting this blog to keep a record of my learnings and vent a little. I also want to get back into the habit of writing for myself, outside of work.

Here's what I plan to write about in the future!
