My site has officially launched!! Which is to say that I’ve gone from keeping it a secret to casually shrugging and mumbling, "Sure, you can look if you want but I still have a lot to add..."

Building this site is exciting. I've always loved tinkering with website code, but the last time I put genuine effort into learning HTML or CSS was when I was middle school, using in-line styling for my [Neopets](http://www.neopets.com/) pet pages. A lot has changed since then! (No one likes in-line styling anymore).

I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to style the static pages, then Frankensteined together a sort of half-Bootstrap half-[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site so I could have a blog attached. My next project will probably be to learn Sass (or... Less??) so I can streamline things a little more.

I've spent the last year learning a lot of new things, so I'm starting this blog to keep a record of my learnings and vent. I also want to write more for myself.
