Since the election, I've been thinking a lot about how I want to live differently. In these unprecedented times, I think it's not really appropriate to keep going on as if nothing's happened.

Here's some stuff that I've decided to try to do more in the coming year.

 - Donate more to local charities and organizations.
 - Call my representatives and attend town halls.
 - Intercede if I personally witness any harassment.
 - Do at least one fundraising project for a local charity. I'll likely try [Live Below the Line](https://www.livebelowtheline.com/) this year to raise money for my local foodbank.
