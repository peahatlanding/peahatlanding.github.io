Since the election, I've been thinking a lot about how I want to live differently. It just doesn't feel appropriate to go on as if nothing's changed.

Here are some goals I've made for the coming year:
 - Donate more to local charities and organizations.
 - Call my representatives and attend town halls.
 - Intercede if I personally witness any harassment.
 - Do at least one fundraising project for a local charity. I'll likely try [Live Below the Line](https://www.livebelowtheline.com/) this year to raise money for my local foodbank.

I want this to be my new default. It's not much, but maybe I can build on it over time.
